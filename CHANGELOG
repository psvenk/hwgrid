hwgrid.cls changelog

Version 1.1 - 2 September 2019

- Added list of events (holidays, etc. corresponding to each date) under the dates, read from a new argument to \insertgrid just before the list of classes.

- Classes (leftmost column) are ragged-right

- \insertgridfixed now takes the height of each class row as an argument (the last argument) instead of using 80pt.
